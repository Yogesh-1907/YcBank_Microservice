## üìÇ How to Run

> Make sure you run the services in the following order for proper dependency loading:

1. **Eureka Server**
2. **Config Server**
3. **Accounts / Loans / Cards Services**
4. **Gateway Server**

Each service has its own `application.yml` and runs on its own port. Eureka and Config Server allow dynamic registration and externalized configuration.
